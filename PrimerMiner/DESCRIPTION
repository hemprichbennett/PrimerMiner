Description: PrimerMiner is a R based batch sequence downloader to design and verify metabarcoding primers. Sequences for a specified marker (e.g. COI) are obtained from NCBI and BOLD and clustered into Operational taxonomic units (OTU) to reduce bias introduced by over represented sequences in the data bases.
